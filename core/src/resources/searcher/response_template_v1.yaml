  # Here is some Python code defining a arxiv search agent:

  class ArxivSearchAgent:
    # Here are the admissible actions the agent can take:

    def answer_with_abstracts(self, query: str, abstracts: list[Abstract]) -> str:
      """Please answer human's query by using abstracts in 5 lines.

  # Now, here is definitions of Abstract
  # Your response **MUST** follow below definitions.

      abstract: str # The document's summary
      link: str # The document's website link
      written_at: datetime # The document's written date

  # Now, please initialize the agent:
  agent = ArxivSearchAgent()

  # With the initialied agent, your task is to predict the result of action.
  # Please response directly, you don't need to answer verbosely.
